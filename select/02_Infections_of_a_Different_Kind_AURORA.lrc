[00:17.94] It's a feeling growing old with time
[00:22.59] Like restless inner leaves coming down
[00:27.47] The world is a hole and we all seem to fall
[00:32.68] Down and down
[00:39.18] 
[00:37.18] And the universe is growing tall
[00:41.10] And we're all caving into dreams of the space
[00:46.23] Unfolding her arms cannot do any harm
[00:51.17] Violent contractions
[01:01.17] 
[00:55.66] And if there is a God, would we even know his name?
[01:21.16] 
[01:11.16] And if there is a God, I think he would shake his head
[01:21.51] And turn away
[01:28.01] 
[01:24.74] So belong to a soul
[01:28.22] Be God in the shape of a girl
[01:31.57] Who walks this world
[01:34.91] And I beg, I beg to be drained
[01:41.75] From the pain I've soaked myself in
[01:45.18] So I can stay okay
[01:50.73] And more than okay for a while
[01:56.69] For a while, for a while
[02:08.69] 
[02:08.05] Infections of a different kind
[02:11.56] The world is being attacked by your pain
[02:15.01] If I'm the world then why would I hurt
[02:19.08] All that is living?
[02:28.58] 
[02:22.07] And if there is a God, would he then believe in us? Ah ah
[02:36.09] And if there is a God, I think he can't hear all of us
[03:03.09] 
[02:49.31] Belong to a soul
[02:52.40] Be God in the shape of a girl
[02:55.92] Who walks this world
[02:59.49] And I beg, I beg to be drained
[03:06.06] From the pain I've soaked myself in
[03:09.62] So I can stay okay
[03:15.53] And more than okay for a while
[03:20.55] For a while, for a while
[03:32.55] 
[04:31.90] This is the breath, this is the breath
