```lrc
[00:17.98] It's a feeling growing old with time
[00:22.55] Like restless inner leaves coming down
[00:27.43] The world is a hole and we all seem to fall
[00:32.63] Down and down
[00:39.13] 
[00:37.18] And the universe is growing tall
[00:41.15] And we're all caving into dreams of the space
[00:46.25] Unfolding her arms cannot do any harm
[00:51.17] Violent contractions
[01:01.17] 
[00:55.62] And if there is a God, would we even know his name?
[01:21.12] 
[01:11.11] And if there is a God, I think he would shake his head
[01:21.51] And turn away
[01:28.01] 
[01:24.74] So belong to a soul
[01:28.26] Be God in the shape of a girl
[01:31.52] Who walks this world
[01:34.92] And I beg, I beg to be drained
[01:41.73] From the pain I've soaked myself in
[01:45.11] So I can stay okay
[01:50.77] And more than okay for a while
[01:56.62] For a while, for a while
[02:08.62] 
[02:08.03] Infections of a different kind
[02:11.53] The world is being attacked by your pain
[02:15.08] If I'm the world then why would I hurt
[02:19.05] All that is living?
[02:28.55] 
[02:22.09] And if there is a God, would he then believe in us? Ah ah
[02:36.04] And if there is a God, I think he can't hear all of us
[03:03.04] 
[02:49.39] Belong to a soul
[02:52.47] Be God in the shape of a girl
[02:55.98] Who walks this world
[02:59.48] And I beg, I beg to be drained
[03:06.00] From the pain I've soaked myself in
[03:09.63] So I can stay okay
[03:15.57] And more than okay for a while
[03:20.56] For a while, for a while
[03:32.56] 
[04:31.96] This is the breath, this is the breath
